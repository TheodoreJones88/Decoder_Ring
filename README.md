# Decoder_Ring
My decoder ring project.

## Explaination
This project was for me to make a decoder that used 3 different ways to decode/encode messages. The first way is called the Ceasar shift method. This method takes in a message and a number that's positive or negative. If the number is positive then each alphabet in the message is shifted to the right by x number of times. So if the number is 3 then the letter "A" becomes "D" because "D" is 3 places to the right of "A". If the number is Negative then every letter in the message shifts to the left. The second way this app encodes/decodes messages is the Polybius method. This method involed a chart that hold each letter in a grid of its own (except i/j). Each grid is assigned a number for its x and y axis ranging from 1 - 5. The goal of this project was to encode and decode these messages based off of the chart. The third way to encode/decode messages was the Substitution method. With this one you needed to created your own aplhabet out of any random 26 character. These characters can be any charcters you like. Those characters will then take the place of the original alphabet and the corresponding letter will be switched with your newly created alphabet. so if the first 3 characters of your created alphabet was "hg(" then "cab" would become "(hg".
